# gittuf Documentation

gittuf's documentation is structured to address the needs of three categories of
users who need to use gittuf.

- If you just want to verify a repository against its own gittuf policy, you're
  a **consumer**.
- If you're contributing changes to a Git repository with gittuf enabled, you're
  a **contributor**.
- If you're setting up or managing gittuf on a Git repository, you're a
  **maintainer**.

Each type of user needs to read their section, and the sections that come before
it. For example, a consumer need only read [Part 2: gittuf for Consumers], but a
maintainer should read the sections for all roles, e.g. [Part 2: gittuf for
Consumers], [Part 3: gittuf for Contributors], and [Part 4: gittuf for
Maintainers].
