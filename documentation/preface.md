# Part 1: Preface

Thank you for your interest in gittuf! We hope both gittuf and this
documentation will be useful to you on your journey of securing your Git
repository.

Before you dive in, the below sections contain information that might make
things clearer when you read.

## Documentation Conventions

We follow several conventions and terminology decisions in this documentation.

### Information Boxes

Throughout gittuf's documentation, you may see the following boxes:

{: .experimental}

> This is an **Experimental Feature** box, and alerts you to operations or
> features in gittuf that are still experimental, and may change.

{: .info}

> This is an **Info** box, and contains information that we want to draw your
> attention to.

{: .heads-up}

> This is a **Heads Up** box, and contains information that may impact your
> use of gittuf.

{: .warning}

> This is a **Warning** box, and alerts you to operations in gittuf that may
> have unforeseen consequences, or information that you need to be aware of.


Make sure that you read the information in these boxes especially carefully.

### Terminology

We aim to use standard terminology whenever possible, but there are a few terms
that may be a bit obscure or have different meaning.

We suggest that you read through the [Trust Architecture] and [Design]
documentation at least once if you are unsure as to the terminology in this
documentation.
