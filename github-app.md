The [gittuf GitHub app](https://github.com/gittuf/github-app) can be installed
on a repository to observe pull request approvals and merges. The app records
attestations for these events, allowing developers to continue using GitHub's
pull request workflow and code review tools while meeting gittuf policies. The
gittuf community operates an instance of this app.
