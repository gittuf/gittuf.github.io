# Contributing to gittuf's Website and Documentation

(If you want to contribute to gittuf itself, see the [contributing guide] on the
[gittuf repository].)

We are always looking to improve the gittuf website and the documentation for
gittuf. Similar to contributions submitted to gittuf itself, some guidelines
apply.

## Contributor Workflow

When submitting changes to the gittuf website or documentation, contributors
must open a GitHub pull request to the repository.

gittuf uses the NYU Secure Systems Lab [development workflow]. They are reviewed
by one or more [maintainers] and undergo automated testing such as (but not
limited to):

* Build testing
* Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) check

## Other Guidelines

Contributors to gittuf must abide by the project's [code of conduct]. Any
questions regarding the gittuf community's governance and code of conduct may be
directed to the project's [Technical Steering Committee].
