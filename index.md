gittuf provides a security layer for Git using the concepts introduced by
[The Update Framework (TUF)]. Among other features, gittuf includes the ability
to distribute and revoke signing keys used in a repository, and define
permissions for repository branches, tags, and files.

## Current Status

gittuf is currently in an early-development stage and is therefore considered
pre-alpha. Please do not use it in a production system or repository.
