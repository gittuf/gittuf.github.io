gittuf is a platform-agnostic Git security system. The maintainers of a Git
repository can use gittuf to protect the contents of a Git repository from
unauthorized or malicious changes. Most significantly, gittuf's policy controls
and enforcement is not tied to your source control platform (SCP) or "forge",
meaning any developer can independently verify that a repository's changes
followed the expected security policies. In other words, gittuf removes the
forge as a single point of trust in the software supply chain!

gittuf is an incubating project at the [Open Source Security Foundation
(OpenSSF)] as part of the [Supply Chain Integrity Working Group].

## Features

Some of gittuf's features are:
- **Key distribution, rotation, and revocation:** While Git supports
  cryptographically signing commits and tags, it does not provide mechanisms to
  securely manage these keys. To verify a signature, you must identify the
  trusted keys using out-of-band mechanisms. In the case of a compromise and a
  subsequent key revocation, you must also identify which historic signatures
  issued [before the revocation can still be
  trusted](https://karl.kornel.us/2017/10/welp-there-go-my-git-signatures/).
  gittuf implements key management features to securely distribute, rotate, and
  revoke keys trusted for a repository.
- **Granular write access control rules:** gittuf rules grant granular
  permissions to protect portions of the repository like specific branches,
  tags, and files/folders from unauthorized changes. Each rule can also be
  configured to specify the minimum number of approvals required to satisfy the
  rule.
- **Self-contained, {system}-agnostic:** gittuf associates all aspects of a
  repository's security such as policies and activity information with the
  repository itself. While this is primarily to avoid trusting any other system
  for the security of a repository, it also means that important information
  such as the history of code review approvals are tracked in the repository
  itself, meaning this information is not lost when a repository is moved from
  one platform to another!
- **Backwards compatible:** gittuf is designed to be compatible with existing
  systems in the Git ecosystem, including popular SCPs like GitHub and GitLab.
  gittuf can also be used with existing repositories.

## Current Status

gittuf is currently in alpha. It is not yet intended for use in a production
system or repository. We're now actively working on making gittuf more usable so
it has lesser impact on developer workflows. Contributions are welcome, please
refer to the [contributing guide]. Some of the features listed above are being
actively developed, please refer to the [roadmap] and the repository's issue
tracker for more details.

## Installation & Get Started

See the [get started guide] in the [gittuf repository].
